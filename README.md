###Style Requirements

* A custom Google font for highlights: Contrail One
* A specified standard san-serif web font for data: Open Sans
* A specified standard serif web font for text: Lora
* Specified different font colors for all three font usages
* A background color for the default page background (make sure font colors have good contrast and are readable on this background)
* A different background color for elements such boxes and tables (so make sure the font colors contrast against this well, too!)
* Anything else you'd like to add related to style. But remember: simplicity, clarity, and consistency are good things in design.
* Be thoughtful about layout and overall organization of the page.
* Include all of the typical stuff that you'll find on the home page of a business: locations, hours, contact information, some text about how awesome the business is, etc. Be creative, and again, think about what is meaningful to a typical end user.
